<h1> Snakes on a Sphere </h1>
</center>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> This project implements a 3D version of the classic game <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)">snake</a>.  Unlike
traditional snake (or snakes on a plane), this version takes place on a sphere.
The player takes control of a snake whose goal is to eat all of the eggs it can
find on the alien planet it inhabits.  Unfortunately, as the snake eats, it
grows, increasing the chance of colliding with itself and dying.   The game can
paused with the space bar, the camera can be controlled with the mouse, the
game can be restarted after losing by pressing any key, and pressing escape
quits.
